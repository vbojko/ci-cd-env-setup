SETUP CI CD ENV
===============

This repo will automatically setup a "CI/CD" environment on the laptop with: Gitlab, Jenkins, Consul, Minishift and some default pipeline/examples

The documentation of the examples with labs can be found hee: <https://f5-ci-cd-lab.readthedocs.io/en/master/>

Requirements
------------

* This solution is created for MAC OS X or 2xVM Running Centos.
* AS3 must be installed on the BIG-IP devices used <https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-appsvcs-extension/releases>

CentOs specific requirements:

Prepare the CentOs platforms
----------------------------

* The user must be allowed to do sudo commands without password (<https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-edit-the-sudoers-file-on-ubuntu-and-centos>)

      sudo visudo
      # add a line like this: 
      "centos ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL"
      

* You must have created a ssh key and use ssh-copy-id locally on the IP of the device (not localhost)\

      ssh-keygen
      ssh-copy-id centos@hostIP
    
* Disable SELinux (a reboot is required after)

      sudo vi /etc/selinux/config
      # and modify 
      "SELINUX=enforcing" to: "SELINUX=disabled"

* Reboot the instance

then:

    sudo yum update -y
    sudo yum upgrade -y
    sudo yum install -y  git docker net-tools wget firewalld
    sudo systemctl start docker
    sudo systemctl enable docker
    sudo systemctl start firewalld
    sudo systemctl enable firewalld
    # Allow the user to run docker command without sudo - needed for Minishift
    sudo groupadd docker
    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

If you use vanilla CentOS, you need to:

    sudo yum install libvirt -y
    sudo yum install quemu-kvm -y

see: <https://docs.okd.io/latest/minishift/getting-started/setting-up-virtualization-environment.html>

Make sure that your PATH variable contains /usr/local/bin 
    
    PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin; export PATH

Reboot your VM. it's required to be able to run docker command without sudo. Changes won't be taken
into account until a restart is done.

Make sure that docker and firewalld are runnning:

    sudo systemctl status docker
    sudo systemctl status firewalld

Installing the env - pipeline tools
-----------------------------------

** YOU MUST INSTALL THE PIPELINE TOOLS FIRST **

On one of the VM, we will install all the pipeline tools:

* Gitlab
* Jenkins
* Consul

To install the pipeline tools, retrieve the github repository:

    git clone https://github.com/nmenant/ci-cd-env-setup
    cd ci-cd-env-setup

Run 

      build-env.sh pipeline
to install the different components:

* Update the system
* A user-defined network (ci-cd-docker-net) in docker will be created (172.18.0.0/16)
* Gitlab will run on 172.18.0.2
* Jenkins will run on 172.18.0.3
* Consul will run on 172.18.0.4

Everything will be started at the same time

Installing the env - minishift
-----------------------------------

On the other VM, we will install minishift

To install minishift, retrieve the github repository:

    git clone https://github.com/nmenant/ci-cd-env-setup
    cd ci-cd-env-setup

Run 

      build-env.sh minishift 
      

In case you need ansible and  AWS CLI on Jenkins server, Run 

      build-env2.sh minishift 
to install minishift:

* Update the system
* Install Minishift in the VM. You'll be requested for the IP of this VM, the IP of the VM running the pipeline tools and the IP of the BIG-IP
    Consider that the credentials are *admin*/*admin* to it - if not, you need to update the Consul KV for BIG-IP credentials - see below)

Once minishift started, its GUI will be available on <https://IP:8443/console>

login by default with:

* Login: dev
* Password: dev

Credentials
-----------

Here is the list of login/password for the different tools:

* Gitlab: TenantA/Pa55w0rd
* Jenkins: TenantA/Pa55w0rd
* Minishift: dev/dev
* Consul: no auth needed to handle the kv database

Finalize the setup
------------------

There is one last step to do to finalize your setup: update the service definition tied to the demo app.

To update the service definition, you may go to your gitlab <http://IP:1080/tenanta/my-webapp-ci-cd-demo/blob/dev/my-adc-cluster/service-definition.json>

You need to edit this file to change :

* the Virtual Server IP Address of the service.

    "virtualAddresses": [
        "172.16.1.90"
    ],

* the URI of the security policy.

change the following line to replace *192.168.143.1* with the IP of your VM running Gitlab:

     "url": "http://192.168.143.1:1080/Larry/Security-Policies/raw/master/policies/asm-policy-linux-high.xml",

This will trigger a webhook in Jenkins but it's irrelevant, it won't be processed

Trigger a deployment/Delete the app
-----------------------------------

To deploy/delete the App, it is fairly straightforward. You need to add/delete the "DELETE" file in the repo *my-webapp-ci-cd-demo*.

**Don't forget to go to the Dev branch!!!**

By default this file exist. You just need to delete it from the repo and the app will be deployed.

If you want to remove the App, you just need to put back a DELETE file at the root of the directory.

you have a more detailed lab guide here: <https://f5-ci-cd-lab.readthedocs.io/en/master/class1/module2/module2.html>

UDF - Restart the environment
-----------------------------

If you switch off/pause off your VMs, you'll need to restart some of your components:

* the gitlab/jenkins/consul containers should restart automatically since they have been started with the option *--restart always*
* You'll need to start again minishift. To do this, just run again the command in the *ci-cd-env-setup* folder

    build-env.sh minishift

Update Consul
-------------

Consul can be used to store infrastructure information leveraged by Jenkins. By default it contains the following default KV:

    GET http://127.0.0.1:8500/v1/kv/?keys

    [
    "Minishift/minishift_ip",
    "Minishift/minishift_port",
    "Minishift/minishift_token",
    "tenanta/ADC-Services/cluster-nicolas/cluster_credentials",
    "tenanta/ADC-Services/cluster-nicolas/cluster_ips"
    ]

They are used in the 2 default jenkins pipeline. You still need to update a few variables based on your env:

* you need to update minishift_ip with the IP of your minishift cluster. You can get this information with the command 

      minishift ip
* you need to update minishift_token with the token you'll get by creating a service account allowed to do API calls in your minishift project (<https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.10/rest_api/index.html> - right now there is a bug in the doc, it's 

      eval $(minishift oc-env)
      oc policy add-role-to-user admin system:serviceaccount:test:robot
      oc serviceaccounts get-token robot > robot-token.json
      
and not *oc policy add-role-to-user admin system:serviceaccounts:test:robot*)

* you need to update cluster_ips with the cluster of your BIG-IPs. You can put a single IP for a standalone deployment

      curl -X PUT -d cluster_ip http://127.0.0.1:8500/v1/kv/tenanta/ADC-Services/cluster-nicolas/cluster_ips
* if you changed the default credentials of your BIG-IP, you'll need to also update cluster_credentials.
Consul credentials have the format of "username:password"  

      curl -X PUT -d username:password tenanta/ADC-Services/cluster-nicolas/cluster_credentials

Update those values accordingly to your infrastructure

    # To check a key value:
    curl http://127.0.0.1:8500/v1/kv/tenanta/ADC-Services/cluster-nicolas/cluster_ips?raw
    # IMPORTANT:
    # Consul encodes values per default in base64. To optain a non base64 value the GET request has to end with "?raw"
    # If "?raw" is not appendd then Consul will respond with a json blob and an base64 encoded value.

    # To update the value of a key:
    curl -X PUT -d "value" http://127.0.0.1:8500/v1/kv/tenanta/ADC-Services/cluster-nicolas/cluster_ips
        
    # To update the BIG-IP credentials: 
    curl -X PUT -d username:password tenanta/ADC-Services/cluster-nicolas/cluster_credentials
